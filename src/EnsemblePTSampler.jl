"""
    tevolve(swapfraction, betas, tc)

Returns `new_betas`, which are evolved according to a rule to equalise
temperature swap rates over a timescale `tc`.

The rule is formulated in terms of a quantity `x[i]`, which is the logit
transform of `beta[i]` relative to its neighbours (recall that `beta` is the
*inverse* temperature, so decreases as `i` increases):

    x[i] = log(beta[i] - beta[i+1]) - log(beta[i-1] - beta[i])

`x` maps the range between `beta[i+1]` and `beta[i-1]` to `-Inf` to `Inf`.  We
evolve `x` via

    x_new[i] = x[i] + 2.0*(swapfraction[i] - swapfraction[i-1])/(tc*(swapfraction[i] + swapfraction[i-1]))

where `swapfraction[i]` measures the fraction of accepted swaps between
temperature `i` and temperature `i+1` (i.e. between chain `i` and the
next-highest temperature chain) and `tc` is a "time constant" that controls the
(exponential) rate of convergence of `x`.

This is similar to the evolution rule in [Vousden, Farr, & Mandel
(2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016MNRAS.455.1919V/abstract).

    run_mcmc(pts, loglike, logprior, betas, nstep; [thin=1])

Run a MCMC simulation of length `nstep`.

The simulation will consist of a "burnin" phase and a "sampling" phase, each
involving half `nstep` iterations.  During "burnin", the temperatures of the
chain will adapt with a time constant of 1/4 of the burnin length.  During
sampling the temperatures are fixed to preserve detailed balance.

The function will return `(chain, chainloglike, chainlogprior, new_betas)` where
each returned chain value has an extra dimension appended counting steps of the
chain (so `chain` is of shape `(ndim, nwalkers, ntemp, nstep)`, for example).

# Arguments
* `pts` a `(ndim, nwalkers, ntemp)` array with the current state.
* `loglike` a function giving the log-likelihood for parameters.
* `logprior` a function giving the log-prior for parameters.
* `betas` a `(ntemp,)` array of inverse temperatures.
